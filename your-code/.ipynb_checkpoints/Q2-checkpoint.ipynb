    "Now we want to enhance the `get_bow_from_docs` function so that it will work with HTML webpages. In HTML, there are a lot of messy codes such as HTML tags, Javascripts, [unicodes](https://www.w3schools.com/charsets/ref_utf_misc_symbols.asp) that will mess up your bag of words. We need to clean up those junk before generating BoW.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, what you will do is to define several new functions each of which is specialized to clean up the HTML codes in one aspect. For instance, you can have a `strip_html_tags` function to remove all HTML tags, a `remove_punctuation` function to remove all punctuation, a `to_lower_case` function to convert string to lowercase, and a `remove_unicode` function to remove all unicodes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then in your `get_bow_from_doc` function, you will call each of those functions you created to clean up the HTML before you generate the corpus.\n",

      "\n",
      "I moved to Barcelona three years ago  and fell in love with the city  so it was clear to me that I wanted to do a bootcamp here  I talked to people about the best technologies and languages to learn  and everyone confirmed that Ironhack had the best full stack JavaScript curriculum  Barcelona has a good tech atmosphere and a growing startup scene  I’d eventually like to have the flexibility to work remotely  and I think that Barcelona will allow that \n",

      "\n",
      "The hours were very intense  Officially  the hours are 9am to 6pm  like a full time job  but I don’t remember many days when we actually finished at 6  If you’re at Ironhack  then it’s in your best interest to get as much out of the program as you can \n",

      "The teaching was also quite intense  I’m 30 now so I had been out of school for many years  and going back to lectures was a lot more demanding than I thought it would be  But as intense as it was  it was also very satisfying  Your character really shows when you’re learning web development   you have to deal with daily frustrations and a lot of challenges  but overcoming those challenges is really rewarding \n",

      "What was your cohort like \n",
      "\n",
      "Ironhack was one of the most diverse experiences I’ve ever had  Some of my classmates were 18 and had come straight out of high school  and the oldest guy was in his late 40s  The average person was somebody who had decided to change their career \n",
      "\n",
      "We were very international  There were around 22 students in my class   four of those students were Spanish  and the rest of them were from all over the world  including Europeans and Latin Americans \n",
      "\n",
      "What was your favorite project that you built at Ironhack \n",
      "\n",
      "My favorite project was my first project   I created a game of blackjack with front end JavaScript  Since it was my first project  I felt like I had accomplished something that I never in my life thought I could have accomplished  Of course we got help from the teachers  but it’s quite impressive to see what you  yourself are capable of doing  Before we started the project  I was clueless  I honestly had no idea what I was going to do  how I was going to do it  and I didn’t believe I could do it  But after completing the project  it was really impressive to see what I could get myself to do \n",
      "\n",
      "How did Ironhack prepare you for job hunting \n",
      "\n",
      "When I was researching bootcamps  it was really important for me to be able to land a job as soon as possible  and Ironhack pretty much guarantees that almost all alumni who want to find work will find work in the field  Right after bootcamp  we had a hiring day where more than 20 recruiters from tech companies came to the campus to see our work  It was a quick interview where we show them our project  they ask questions  they get to know us  and we get to know the companies \n",
      "\n",
      "Sonia  my Careers Adviser  was always getting in touch with companies  and getting my input about what I’d like to do  On top of that  I thought it was amazing that after I landed a job and needed some guidance  one of the TAs still gave me advice and input  Even now  I feel like I can go back to Ironhack and get support any time I need it  I try not to milk it  but they are just so helpful and so caring \n",
      "\n",
      "So you’ve been working at Everis for 7 months now  Congrats  How did you find the job \n",
      "\n",
      "Everis did come to Ironhack for the hiring day  but I didn’t get a chance to talk to them because there were so many companies there  So the next day  I contacted them and told them I had missed them  but I wanted to get to know them   I was quite active about reaching out to companies  They replied immediately  I went into the office that same day for an interview  Within two weeks  they called me in for a second interview  and shortly after that I received an offer  I was exhausted after graduating from Ironhack  so I took a month off over the holidays  but about a month into my job search  I was working at Everis \n",
      "\n",
      "Can you tell me about Everis and what you work on there \n",
      "\n",
      "Everis is a consultancy  so we work on projects with different clients  I’m a Junior Front End Developer  and I work with Angular and Typescript  It’s a purely front end job  which is what I wanted \n",
      "\n",
      "I’m on my second project since I started at Everis  The first project was a web app to help organizations apply for governmental loans  It was a very small  global team   two people in Barcelona  two people in Zaragoza  Spain  and the project manager was based in Brussels  Belgium  For my current project there are four of us and we’re all based in Barcelona  except for the project manager who is based in Zaragoza \n",
      "\n",
      "It’s a huge company  I think there are about 3000 people in Barcelona  and they have branches around the world  The company is very diverse  and the teams are very diverse as well  They have an emphasis on hiring very gender balanced teams  which is nice  Everis is definitely more gender balanced than other companies \n",
      "\n",
      "Are you using the technologies and programming languages at Everis that you learned at Ironhack \n",
      "\n",
      "I’m working in Angular  which is a framework we covered in the third module of Ironhack  There are always new things to learn in Angular  because Angular is quite complex and always evolving  So I haven’t learned any new languages or frameworks  but I had to learn more about Angular on the job \n",
      "\n",
      "Ironhack provided us with the tools to be able to teach ourselves new technologies more easily  In the future  I will inevitably need to learn more languages and frameworks  But now I have the right tools to be able to teach myself a lot more easily than before the bootcamp \n",
      "\n",
      "Since you joined Everis  how do you feel you’ve grown as a front end developer \n",
      "\n",
      "In 6 months  I feel like I’ve become a lot more independent  and I’m less afraid of touching the code  In addition  I’ve developed a passion for problems  As weird as that sounds  I enjoy running into problems because I enjoy solving them  It’s very fulfilling  Honestly  I think Ironhack is the best decision I’ve made in my life in terms of academia and career development  I haven’t regretted it once \n",
      "\n",
      "How has your background in graphic design  finance  and entrepreneurship been useful in your new job as a Front End Developer \n",
      "\n",
      "Graphic design is very much about trends  and it’s been a long time since I studied it  While there are some aspects of design that still apply  a lot has changed  At Everis  when we get a new project  a lot of the design is given by the client   my job is more about implementing the logic and functions rather than the design itself \n",
      "\n",
      "My experience working in finance has definitely been useful at Everis  Having experience in a huge corporation definitely helps you work with other people and clients in a professional environment \n",
      "\n",
      "What’s been the biggest challenge or roadblock in your journey to becoming a Front End Developer \n",
      "\n",
      "Sometimes you can get stuck on a problem for a really long time  and you start having to deal with your own frustrations  The more you get frustrated  the more you block your brain and the less you can really think logically  That’s a challenge that I’ve had to learn to deal with  and I’m really learning how to be calm and patient  I wasn’t a patient person before  and I’m now really seeing the results of patience \n",
      "\n",
      "It sounds like Ironhack has stayed involved in your career   have you kept in touch with other alumni \n",
      "\n",
      "I was just at Ironhack last week actually and I’m going again soon  A lot of people from my cohort have left  but I’ve gotten to know people from the cohorts before and after mine  and we’ve become quite tight  It’s a very strong community  Whenever Ironhack hosts events  I prioritize them   it’s a very good atmosphere and a great network  and every time I go there I feel like I’m at home \n",
      "\n",
      "What advice do you have for people making a career change through a coding bootcamp \n",
      "\n",
      "Just do it  My best advice is to stay calm and be aware that you’re going to reach your mental limits  You’re going to have a hard time  but it’s really worth it and it’s very rewarding  There are going to be times when you’ll want to feel very stupid   don’t  If you can be a master of your emotions  then you have a good path ahead \n",

      "What s your background and how did you get involved with Ironhack \n",
      "\n",
      "My background is in strategy consulting  I studied business in London  and then I worked in strategic consulting for tech startups in Spain and California  I worked for the Embassy of Spain in Los Angeles for a little while  and then I launched my own venture there \n",
      "\n",
      "I m actually an Ironhack graduate  Working in the tech industry  I had always been interested in learning how to code  So I did some research online and I found Ironhack  I graduated from Ironhack around a year and a half ago \n",
      "\n",
      "I fell in love with the company’s mission and the community they were creating  You hear some really incredible stories when you re working with people from such diverse backgrounds  After graduating  I kept in touch with Gonzalo Manrique  one of the co founders  so when they decided to expand in Europe  he contacted me about the EMEA  Europe  Middle Eastern  and Africa  Expansion Lead position  It was a no brainer for me \n",
      "\n",
      "Did you attend Ironhack to become a developer or did you just want to pick up coding skills \n",
      "\n",
      "I wanted to pick up coding skills  I think everybody in the future should become literate in some kind of coding language  even if you’re not planning on working as a developer  Most jobs in the future will require a basic knowledge of programming  and I wanted to stay ahead of the curve  If you work in tech  understanding how software is built is a must  regardless of your position  Eventually  machines will dominate the world and you’ll have to speak their language \n",
      "\n",
      "You have this unique perspective of actually being a student before working as staff at Ironhack \n",
      "\n",
      "Absolutely  It s easier for me to explain the benefits behind Ironhack because I ve lived through the whole experience  It s really great when we do events and prospective students ask me about Ironhack  The first thing I tell them is   Look  I m an alum  I went through the whole experience  I can tell you everything you need to know  and everything you ll go through   It was definitely one of the most challenging and rewarding times in my life \n",
      "\n",
      "Tell us about your role at Ironhack \n",
      "\n",
      "The first step when I started was working with the co founders and the VP of Ops  Expansion  Alex Berriche  to make a strategy plan for Europe  We had various cities in mind and decided to take a structured approach and rank them according to factors we know to be determinants for success  We finally decided Berlin was clearly the next step for us \n",
      "\n",
      "After deciding on a city  I move there to set everything up  There are two main areas I’m responsible for  The first is Operations  HR   setting up the legal entity for Ironhack’s new campus  securing financing for our students etc  and getting together a dream team to run the campus \n",
      "\n",
      "The second key area is marketing  We tailor our strategy to each market  It’s all about understanding the different customer segments and building brand awareness   once people understand our value proposition they’re always convinced  We focus strongly on partnering up with cool companies like N26 or MoBerries  and doing free workshops and events for prospective students  It’s all about getting people excited about learning new digital skills \n",
      "\n",
      "Our first cohort in Berlin launches May 21  2018 \n",
      "\n",
      "What stood out about Berlin  Germany  Why is this city a great place for Ironhack to have a campus \n",
      "\n",
      "Ironhack already has campuses in Europe   Madrid  Barcelona  and Paris   so we want to continue to be present in the strongest tech ecosystems  and Berlin is proving to be an incredible tech ecosystem  Berlin is home to the single largest software market in Europe   that s around a quarter of the European market by value  which is pretty crazy  There are around 2 000 to 2 500 active tech startups here  including some really disruptive companies  The tech ecosystem is booming  and the city has the ability to attract and retain talented people like no other place  People are flocking to Berlin because they like living here and there’s plenty of job opportunities \n",
      "\n",
      "Also  the IT jobs market in Germany has a growing digital skills gap  There are a lot of new startups that demand developers and designers  along with traditional older companies who are going through a digitalization process  McKinsey released a study saying there would be 100 000 digital jobs in Berlin by 2020  so that was big data point for us \n",
      "\n",
      "Since students can go to university for free in Berlin  why would they want to pay to go to Ironhack \n",
      "\n",
      "Companies are demanding more people with digital skills  and four year universities just can t cater to that market  Ironhack believes universities  regardless of whether they are private or public  are failing to adapt to the digital revolution  The university approach hasn’t changed in 100 years  and getting a job in this day and age requires a different  updated approach \n",
      "\n",
      "Ironhack provides high impact  condensed educational experiences with one objective in mind   getting students from zero to job ready in three months  Because of this  we believe there will always be a gap in the market where we can provide value  Regardless  we are working hard to make it easier for students to have access to our programs by providing financing options through both private and public channels \n",
      "\n",
      "What will make Ironhack stand out amongst the competition in Berlin \n",
      "\n",
      "We are laser focused on one objective  enabling students to secure a job within three months after graduation \n",
      "\n",
      "So how do we achieve that  Well  first we make our students employable  We constantly update our curriculum to ensure we teach the latest technologies that employers actually demand  and we hire professional instructors with real world experience to teach them  We provide career guidance and support throughout the whole program  and students are prepared for technical interviews  behavioral interviews  etc  We believe in learning by doing  so students come out with three projects to show to the world once they’ve graduated \n",
      "\n",
      "We also focus on giving our students access to those opportunities  by securing hiring partners and organizing a career week where students get to meet prospective employers at the end of each cohort \n",
      "\n",
      "What types of applicants are you looking to enroll in the Berlin campus \n",
      "\n",
      "We re looking for career changers  There are so many talented people in Berlin who have moved here looking for opportunities  Ironhack gives you the possibility to specialize and land a job in three months  We cater to anyone who realizes the importance of learning new digital skills and has a passion to learn \n",
      "\n",
      "How many students does Ironhack plan to accommodate at the Berlin campus \n",
      "\n",
      "We re going to have three cohorts in 2018  The first one starts in May  the second one in July and the third one in October  For the first cohort  we re looking at about 20 students  We don t like to have cohorts much bigger than that because we want to guarantee quality  Moving forward we will look to grow our team and number of cohorts  always ensuring students have the best possible experience \n",
      "\n",
      "How do you source new instructors  What will be the instructor  student ratio \n",
      "\n",
      "We hire real professionals who have worked in the tech industry  Our lead instructor for Berlin was working at the Ironhack Paris campus as the lead instructor for a year and he wanted to move to Berlin  He s one of those people who has been coding his whole life  He started his own company  and he s worked in the industry as a lead developer   he has a very impressive background  And he already knows the Ironhack bootcamp and our course  so that s always a plus \n",
      "\n",
      "At Ironhack  a lead instructor leads the whole program  and then we have teaching assistants  who are also coding professionals  for every eight students  to provide support and guide students through the course  For example  in the first cohort  if we have 20 students  we would have one lead instructor and two or three teaching assistants  Having gone through the bootcamp myself  I feel the teaching assistants play an incredibly important role because they provide valuable assistance throughout the whole bootcamp \n",
      "\n",
      "Will the curriculum at Ironhack Berlin be the same as other Ironhack campuses \n",
      "\n",
      "Ironhack’s current curriculum is divided into three modules  Front end  HTML  CSS  Javascript   Backend MEAN Stack  and Microservices with Angular 2  API’s   We are always looking to make our curriculum better  We were teaching Ruby on Rails  but we decided to move on to   Also  something I always tell prospective students is that you learn how to learn  I graduated from the Ruby on Rails course and was able to learn Node js on my own just the next month \n",
      "\n",
      "We re in contact with a lot of startups  so we make sure our curriculum is exactly what employers need and demand  We make a point to keep the curriculum consistent across all campuses  This allows us to have a feedback loop at every campus and ensure consistent quality  So we’re sticking with the same curriculum in every campus for now  but always looking to iterate and make it better \n",
      "\n",
      "Tell us about the Berlin campus  What is the classroom like \n",
      "\n",
      "As with most of our new campuses  we ll be located at a WeWork co working space  a new building called Atrium Tower right on Potsdamer Platz  The space itself is a big room which holds around 40 students  When we visited the space about a month and a half ago  we fell in love with the facilities  The campus is accessible from anywhere in town because of its central location  and it has an incredible terrace at the top \n",
      "\n",
      "When you re going to be learning for three months in an incredibly intense program  being in a nice space with amenities   coffee  snacks  really nice views   is something really important \n",
      "\n",
      "What are some examples of the types of jobs you envision your Berlin graduates landing after bootcamp \n",
      "\n",
      "We have a very strong reputation worldwide  with a global community of alumni and partners  For example  we just signed up N26  a mobile bank to be our hiring partner  We’re in talks with several Berlin companies to sign them up as hiring partners too  At the end of each nine week course  we prepare prospective employers to meet with the students  Like I said  we re very focused on career changers and ensuring our students get a job within three months after graduation \n",
      "\n",
      "In the past  we ve had companies like Google  Twitter  Visa  Rocket Internet  and Magic Leap hire Ironhack graduates  So in Berlin we re looking for the same profiles  Those are global companies we already have partnerships with  so our students already have access to that pool of employers  Then locally  we are looking for the most disruptive companies that are ready to hire entry level junior developers \n",
      "\n",
      "Do you envision Berlin grads staying in Berlin  Is your focus to get people hired in the city where they studied \n",
      "\n",
      "We have a big focus on having a global community  So we really like the idea that our students can access all the communities in all our cities  For example  I recently passed on the resumes of two graduates from the Madrid UX UI course to Berlin based N26  It’s up to each graduate to decide which city to work in \n",
      "\n",
      "A lot of people want to stay in their home city and others don t  so we cater to both  We try to give opportunities to go abroad  and options to work in the local market \n",
      "\n",
      "What would you recommend a complete beginner do to learn more about the tech scene in Berlin \n",
      "\n",
      "I would recommend going to as many meetups and events as you can  I always tell people that you never know what opportunities could arise if you put yourself out there  and start talking to people  We actually just wrote a blog post about How to Land the Tech Job in Berlin  and one piece of advice is to mingle  Just network \n",
      "\n",
      "Then  of course  I would recommend going to the Ironhack meetups  There are a bunch of workshops in Berlin and our informal network is huge  We re doing one free workshop every week and we ll do some bigger events as well \n",
      "\n",
      "What advice do you have for someone who s thinking about attending a coding bootcamp in Berlin and considering Ironhack \n",
      "\n",
      "Form my experience as an alum  I think it s all about the attitude  When you go into a coding bootcamp  there s always this feeling where you re a little bit scared because it is something really demanding  People have a natural tendency to be resistant to learn something so technical  But just start coding  It s not as difficult as it may seem  and having the right guidance is key  We’re actually launching a cool challenge in Berlin   a free online course to encourage people to get their feet wet with coding \n",
      "\n",
      "A lot more people than we believe have the aptitude for it  and actually become really good programmers  You just have to take a leap of faith and commit to three months of very intense work  We have a 90  placement rate and while we do have a rigorous admissions process  the majority of our students get hired  I recommend people to just go for it  I can guarantee that if you have the right attitude  you ll succeed \n",

      "\n",
      "After starting my career in Private Equity  I joined Jumia a Rocket Internet company  also called the African Amazon  I was Head of Operations in North Africa and then Managing Director of Tunisia I got in touch with Ariel and Gonzalo  the founders of Ironhack  and was really inspired by their vision  Also  since I actually attended a coding bootcamp myself  I was excited to come and work in this industry  I saw the great potential the bootcamp model had in Europe and also Latin America  I was keen to have an impact on people’s lives  so I was super receptive to our conversation and working with Ironhack  It was a great fit \n",
      "\n",
      "As the VP of Expansion  can you describe your role \n",
      "\n",
      "As VP of Expansion  I work with the founders to create a strategy and decide which markets make sense for us to open in next  Then I m involved with the operations preparation where I actually launch the new markets \n",
      "\n",
      "There are three main areas to consider when launching in a new market  The first is human resources   we want to build an awesome team including a general manager  We were super excited to find a great GM for our Mexico campus  Marketing and brand awareness is number two  When you re launching in a new market  you want to increase the brand awareness and convince your first students of the benefits of the new campus  It can be difficult in a new market because we are starting from scratch  so we have to leverage the use of marketing channels such as public relations  events  and partnerships to integrate ourselves into the local ecosystem  The third area is legal   making sure the legal administration is completed  If you succeed in those three areas  you are ready to open in any market \n",
      "\n",
      "What stood out about Mexico City  Why did Ironhack choose to open a campus there \n",
      "\n",
      "We are one of the leaders in the coding bootcamp industry globally  and we’ve been thinking about opening in Latin America for quite some time  Latin America is a great market because there is so much demand for tech skills  but there is a limited number of established bootcamps in the area  In 2019 it is estimated there will be a deficit of 150 000 IT jobs in Mexico  so we can have a great impact on that  We want to train the new generation of technology professionals to join the industry  Not many  if any  bootcamps have campuses in the U S   Europe  and in Latin America  so Latin America was very attractive to us \n",
      "\n",
      "Mexico City was the preferred choice because it has a booming tech ecosystem  It s one of the largest markets for startups  Mexico City is the entry for many tech companies moving to Latin America   Facebook  Amazon  and so on   so many tech multinationals are moving in   The ecosystem is not just booming  it s also maturing significantly well as there are plenty of VC’s  accelerators  and company builders \n",
      "\n",
      "Finally  it s a pretty friendly environment for internet technology and computer science  It s a big market to penetrate  but it s less difficult than some other markets because there are no global competitors  There are obviously some local competitors  whom we respect a lot  but we are going to give the Mexico City ecosystem access to Ironhack’s global community which is already present in Miami  Paris  Barcelona  and Madrid  We think building ties within those markets will excite students learning in Mexico City \n",
      "\n",
      "There are only a few bootcamps in Mexico City  How will Ironhack stand out once other bootcamps start to pop up \n",
      "\n",
      "Ironhack will stand out because we are global  We have already learned so much about running a bootcamp  because each market we operate in has different standards and different challenges  So by bringing this experience into the market  we are raising the coding bootcamp standards for Mexico City  Ironhack has graduated 1 000 students  so we have a large community  We have alumni working for Amazon  Google  and IBM  which is a big plus  We have great reviews on Course Report  and we have great student satisfaction for our curriculum  Over the four years we have been operating  we have continued to improve our teaching methods \n",
      "\n",
      "What is the Ironhack Mexico City campus like \n",
      "\n",
      "Our offices are at the WeWork Insurgentes coworking space  and it s amazing to work alongside different Mexico City startups and see how dynamic the space is  It’s super exciting  We’re in the Colonia Napoles  which is like a district of startups  At WeWork we take up two rooms of 20 x 30 feet each which hold between 15 to 20 students  We will start with one class  and then eventually have two classes rolling at the same time   one UX UI design course  and one web development course \n",

      "Our objective at Ironhack is not quantitative  it s more qualitative so we are not going to accept students if they don t have the required technical level  We are selective with students and we don t accept everyone \n",
      "\n",
      "Could you describe the Ironhack application process  Is it the same across campuses \n",
      "\n",
      "Yes  We have two interviews   one personal interview and one technical interview  You can make it through the technical interview even if you don t have tons of knowledge  but you must be a hard worker  If you prepare your case  you can make it in  but we want to be selective \n",
      "\n",
      "Before the bootcamp starts we also have pre work and the objective is to have everyone at the same knowledge level when we start the course  People are spending a lot of time and money to really improve  so the courses are very intensive for that reason \n",
      "\n",
      "Ironhack teaches UX UI design and web development  Will you be teaching the same curriculum in Mexico City \n",
      "\n",
      "We collect feedback in each market  and with each piece of feedback we receive  we improve our curriculum little by little  We trust and use the same curriculum in every market  You can’t scale efficiently if you have each market doing different classes  The feedback loops in all the different markets allow us to have the best quality program  I don’t think we could have the best quality if we made too many specificities for the various cities \n",
      "\n",
      "How many instructors will you have at the Mexico City campus \n",
      "\n",
      "The number of instructors will grow as the number of students and the number of classes increase  For instance  at the Paris campus  four months after launching we had seven teachers  It will be the same for Mexico  So we’ll start with one instructor and then after a few months  seven  and after one year maybe 10   we re going to see how fast it grows \n",
      "\n",
      "Since Ironhack is a global bootcamp  how do you help with the job search and placement  What sort of jobs do you expect graduates to get \n",
      "\n",
      "We are trying to build partnerships with Linio  TIP  and many Mexican startups where we can place our students  Companies will be invited to Hiring Week at the end of the bootcamp to see what type of talent we produce  We’ll start by targeting companies in Mexico City and then we’ll expand and make partnerships with companies in Guadalajara and Monterrey as a second step \n",
      "\n",
      "Most of our graduates become junior developers  We have less entrepreneurs and more junior developers  Ironhack focuses on career changers and trying to help them to achieve their ambitions so that’s why we are so focused on placement with Iron Week  and a placement manager in each market \n",
      "\n",
      "Is it pretty normal for graduates to stay in the city where they studied \n",
      "\n",
      "We are seeing graduates stay in the city where they studied  unless they’re coming from abroad  We have a few international students and currently  most of them go to the Barcelona and Paris campuses  We don t know about Mexico City graduates yet  but most of our applications so far are from Mexico   with some international applicants as well \n",
      "\n",
      "If someone is a beginner and thinking about attending a coding bootcamp in Mexico City like Ironhack  do you have any meetup or event suggestions \n",
      "\n",
      "Yes  Ironhack is doing a huge full day event at WeWork on December 9th  Anyone can attend and it’s free  This is a great opportunity to learn about tech  discover the Mexico City ecosystem and decide if you want to apply to Ironhack \n",
      "\n",
      "What advice do you have for people thinking about attending a coding bootcamp like Ironhack \n",
      "\n",
      "The first thing is  it’s an amazing commitment  and if you are applying for good reasons and have the technical ability  you will be accepted and get the best experience  It s a once in a lifetime experience to spend nine weeks changing your career  You will learn so much  meet new companies  and get hired  If you want to learn more  go to the Ironhack website  download the application guide  and come to some events  We have a Meetup group and Facebook page  You can read plenty of reviews of the school on Course Report  If you are sure of your motivations  you are a hard worker  and you’re committed  I m sure you will be accepted \n",
      "\n",
      "Do you have any additional comments about the Ironhack’s new Mexico City campus \n",
      "\n",
      "We are very excited about having an amazing team at WeWork in Mexico City  We are at the center of the startup ecosystem so I think it will be an amazing experience for our students \n",

      "Ironhack is a global web development bootcamp with locations in Madrid  Miami  Barcelona  and now Paris  We spoke with Ironhack’s General Manager for France  François Fillette  to learn more about their new Paris campus  launching June 26th  France is the second largest tech ecosystem in Europe   learn why Ironhack chose to expand to the area  read how the bootcamp will stand out from the rest  and see what resources are available to become a successful bootcamp grad in Paris \n",
      "\n",
      "First  as the France General Manager  tell me how you’ve been involved with the new Ironhack campus \n",
      "\n",
      "Sure  As a General Manager  I have been involved in all the dimensions related to the new campus   finding an amazing place for our students  recruiting a team of A players  setting up the docs and processes and so on  I have been working with Alex  our Head of International Expansion  who has been tremendously helpful  We have worked super hard over the last few weeks to make sure that our Paris campus will be on the same standards as the others \n",
      "\n",
      "What’s your background and how did you get involved with bootcamps  What drew you to want to work with Ironhack \n",
      "\n",
      "I was coming back from San Francisco  where I was working as VP of Strategy and Business Development for CodinGame  One of my VC friends told me that Ariel and Gonzalo  the cofounders  were looking for someone to launch Ironhack in France  I met the two of them and immediately embraced their vision  and got impressed by their ability to execute fast and well  I got super excited by the project and the team  so a couple of days later I was in Miami to work on the strategy and the launch plan for France  It’s been 3 months now and honestly  I’ve never been happier to wake up in the morning and start a new day \n",
      "\n",
      "Ironhack is launching their Paris campus on June 26th  Why is Paris a great place for a coding bootcamp  Could you explain Ironhack’s motivation to expand there \n",
      "\n",
      "In terms of funding  France is now the 2nd largest tech ecosystem in Europe  right after England  Over the last 5 years  it has grown exponentially and is now one of the key tech hubs in the world  Take Station F for instance   thanks to Xavier Niel  cofounder of Free   Paris will now have the biggest incubator in the world  That growth has fueled an increasing demand for new skills in the tech economy and the talent shortage is not filled by the traditional education players  There’s an amazing opportunity for us to expand here and we’ll do everything we can to reach our targets \n",
      "\n",
      "There are a few other coding bootcamps in Paris  What will make Ironhack stand out amongst the competition \n",
      "\n",
      "Several initiatives and players have appeared over the last couple of years  which shows you how dynamic the market is  I think 3 elements will set Ironhack apart from the competition  First  our courses are focused on the latest technologies   for example  full stack Javascript for Web Development   and we constantly iterate to improve both the content and the academic experience  Then  we dedicate a large share of the course  60 70   to hands on  real life applications  Students work on real projects  submitted by partners or by themselves if they want to create their startup business  Last  we help with the placement of our students if they’re looking for a job  coaching for technical and behavioral interviews  connections to companies startups  events  etc    We have an average placement rate of 90  after 3 months across our campuses \n",
      "\n",
      "Let’s discuss the Paris campus  What is the classroom like  What neighborhood is it in \n",
      "\n",
      "The campus is located in the new space opened by WeWork  It is located in the 9th arrondissement  near the Paris Opera  It is accessible via 3 metro lines  8 bus lines  2 bike sharing stations  and 2 car sharing stations  It will be open 24 7 for our students \n",
      "\n",
      "The place is absolutely magnificent  both in terms of design and community  Students will enjoy a large classroom close to the patio  and meeting working rooms to complete their projects and assignments \n",
      "\n",
      "What web development and UX UI design tracks or languages are you teaching at this campus and why  Are the ones you’ve chosen particularly popular or relevant in Paris \n",
      "\n",
      "The core curriculum is the same across the different campuses to make sure students have the same academic experience and that we have a strong expertise in our area  Then we tailor the mentors  the events and the projects to the local specificities of the students and of the ecosystem  So  for Web Development  we’ll be focusing on full stack Javascript but we’ll be integrating events and mentors around frameworks really popular here  ex  React or Meteor  and industries that are the rising trends  ex  online media and entertainment  \n",
      "\n",
      "How many instructors and or mentors will you have in Paris \n",
      "\n",
      "We’ll have a lead instructor  who is a professional developer and highly involved in the open source community  He has several years of experience in startups and IT services agencies  He’ll be assisted by a TA  who is a bit more junior  but passionate about education and teaching students  Plus  we’ll have a network of 15 20 mentors to help and coach students  for coding as well as for management  Mentors will be chosen based on the projects of the students  Also  the students of the first Web Development session will be sponsored by Florian Jourda  Florian was the 1st engineer at Box and scaled their dev team from 2 to 300 people  He spent 8 years in the Silicon Valley and is now Chief Product Officer at Bayes Impact  an NGO funded by Google that uses machine learning to solve social problems like unemployment \n",
      "\n",
      "How many students do you usually have in a cohort  How many can you accommodate \n",
      "\n",
      "For that first cohort  we plan to have 20 students maximum because we want to make sure we provide the best experience  That will ensure a strong monitoring of students  as well as a perfect operational execution on our side  For the next cohorts  we’ll increase the number of students  but we won’t go above 30 and we’ll recruit 1 or 2 more TAs to keep the same quality   \n",
      "\n",
      "What kind of hours will students need to put in to be successful \n",
      "\n",
      "Students often ask that question and it’s always hard to answer  Everything depends on their learning curve  On average  students work between 50 to 70 hours a week  mainly on projects and assignments  But we’re fully transparent on this   you can’t learn real hard skills and get a job in 3 months without fully dedicating yourself  We make sure that the atmosphere is as good as it can be so that students won’t see time passing by \n",
      "\n",
      "How is your campus similar or different to the other Ironhack campuses \n",
      "\n",
      "I think that our campus is pretty similar to Miami’s  We are located in an amazing coworking space  in a very nice neighborhood and with lots of startups around  The main difference would be our rooftop on the 8th floor of the building  where we regularly organize events and lunches \n",
      "\n",
      "How are you approaching job placement in a new city  Does Ironhack have an employer network already \n",
      "\n",
      "Job placement is one of the elements we tailor to the local realities and needs  We have already partnered with +20 tech companies  such as Drivy  world leader in peer to peer car rental   Jumia  the equivalent of Amazon in Africa and Middle East   Stootie  Europe leader in peer to peer services   Kima Ventures  VC fund of Xavier Niel  with +400 portfolio companies   etc  Usually  they are large startups  from Series A to Series D  looking to hire web developers  As a GM  it will be part of my job to support and help students accomplish their professional projects with our employer partners \n",
      "\n",
      "What types of companies are hiring developers in Paris and why types of companies do you expect to hire from Ironhack’s Paris campus \n",
      "\n",
      "I think there are 3 types of companies that could hire web developers who graduated from Ironhack   corporations in Telecom Media Technology  startups  from Series A to series D  and IT services companies  The demand is really intense for the last two options  as they’re looking for people mastering the latest technologies  in high volumes  Based on the enthusiasm they’ve expressed when talking with Ironhack  we know they’ll be great recruiting partners   \n",
      "\n",
      "What sort of jobs have you seen graduates get at other Ironhack campuses and what do you expect for Ironhack Paris graduates  Do they usually stay in the city after graduation \n",
      "\n",
      "Based on the metrics of other campuses  usually  50 60  of people join a startup as an employee  a Junior Web Developer  Project Manager or Growth Hacker   20 30  create their own startup after the course  while 20 30  become freelancers  usually in Web Development  and work on a remote basis  We’ll have a good share of students who are not from France originally  so we think some of them might leave Paris after the course  But we’ll help them find the right opportunity abroad and we’ll keep constant interaction with those students \n",
      "\n",
      "What meetups or resources would you recommend for a complete beginner in Paris who wants to get started \n",
      "\n",
      "France has some great players in the field  If you want to get an intro to Javascript  I would recommend you visit OpenClassrooms  Codecademy or CodeCombat  Then  in terms of meetups  The Family and NUMA are two accelerators with outstanding weekly events  Some of them are related to one specific coding topic and they’re usually apprehended at a beginner level \n",
      "\n",
      "Any final thoughts that you’d like our readers to know about Ironhack Paris \n",
      "\n",
      "We want to build something that is nothing like what exists in Paris  In 3 months  you’ll be operational in Web Development  you’ll meet awesome people  students  mentors  entrepreneurs  and you’ll accomplish your professional project  Send us an email to know more at paris@ironhack com  We have a few seats left for the session starting on June 26th  Next session will start on September 4th  If you want to apply  just send us your application through this typeform \n",

      "How did you become a successful UX Designer  Did you get a degree in “UX Design ”\n",
      "\n",
      "I’m a career changer  My background was first in film and creative writing  and I worked in the film industry in Miami before I ended up in Boston  temping as a project manager for a venture capital company with an incubator focused on Harvard and MIT startups  I learned from really smart people about computers  software  graphic design  and project management  and IBM had their Lotus Notes usability labs next door  so I got to participate as a usability tester  I went back to grad school at Bentley University for my Masters in Human Factors in Information Design  and had a magical career doing ethnography and user research at Microsoft  Staples  Adidas  and Reebok  and UX design for Fidelity Investments  Staples  the Federal Reserve  JP Morgan Chase  HR Block  Novartis Pharmaceuticals  and Zumba Fitness \n",

      "\n",
      "After spending years learning User Experience and even getting a Masters degree  why do you believe in the bootcamp model as an effective way to learn UX Design \n",
      "\n",
      "I went through my grad program very quickly  in one year   so I believe that you can learn this material very quickly and then continue learning on the job  That’s exactly why I’ve had a successful career  by specifically going after different verticals  technologies  and platforms  If I hadn’t used something before  I wanted to try it  I believe that you can learn the fundamentals quickly and then refine them throughout your career \n",
      "\n",
      "What made you excited to work at Ironhack in particular  what stands out about Ironhack to you as a professional UX Designer \n",
      "\n",
      "It was the people  I was referred to Ironhack by someone I’ve respected in the industry for years  and they were right  The people running Ironhack are what convinced me to work on this UX Bootcamp \n",
      "\n",
      "Did you have teaching experience prior to teaching at the bootcamp  What is different about teaching at a coding bootcamp \n",
      "\n",
      "I teach now at the University of Miami  at conferences  and bootcamps  At Ironhack  my personal teaching style is to lecture very little  and focus on hands on work  It’s important to know the foundations and principles and science behind what we do  but at the end of the day  you have to deliver  So we spend the majority of our days doing activities  which means running surveys  doing interviews  running usability tests  designing products  I think it’s so important for students to create their portfolio pieces throughout the bootcamp  instead of just having one portfolio project at the end of the course  For someone breaking into the UX community  the portfolio is how students demonstrate their knowledge and how they approach projects \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "This is Ironhack’s first foray into UX UI design courses  Tell us about the curriculum \n",
      "\n",
      "Marcelo Paiva and I created the Ironhack curriculum based on what we would have wanted to learn in a bootcamp if we were to just get started in this field  We follow the user and product development lifecycles to make sure that our students have all the skills they need to be useful right now in the current marketplace \n",
      "\n",
      "We start with user research   how to talk to your target market  the methodology behind that research  what to do with that data  deliverables  and turning that data into concept design \n",
      "\n",
      "We move into information architecture and interaction design  with low fidelity all the way into high fidelity  and micro interaction models  We use Invision  Sketch  and Principal as the tools for that piece of the curriculum  Then we move into visual design for mobile and web  because they are two different beasts \n",
      "\n",
      "Then we move into front end development  where students learn how to implement the designs they’re creating  This is what the industry is looking for right now  the unicorns that can do the HTML and bootstrap to implement their own designs  That will make Ironhack students really effective and marketable \n",
      "\n",
      "Finally  we move into individual projects  Ironhack students are building portfolio pieces from Day One  but towards the end of the course  they work on more specific projects and breakouts for additional topics that we haven’t covered yet \n",
      "\n",
      "I’m so super excited about this bootcamp and I think it’s really valuable \n",
      "\n",
      "Is the push for designers to learn to code the biggest trend in the UX UI field right now \n",
      "\n",
      "It depends on where our graduates choose to work  As part of a smaller team  a UX Designer will have to be more of a generalist  and need to do research  design  and development  If they’re working for a larger organization  they can specialize in a particular field within UX like ethnography  or mobile design  or design thinking  As a whole  I think careers in the UX community are becoming both broader and more specialized  The UX community is both coming together and breaking into niches \n",
      "\n",
      "How many instructors  TAs  and or mentors do you have  Is there an ideal student teacher ratio \n",
      "\n",
      "The student teacher ratio for the UX UI course is 10 1  Many of the required activities are tackled in groups among the students in groups of 3 or 4  As the principal instructor  I lead and teach the main flow of the course  and we have subject matter experts and mentors come in to teach sections of the curriculum that are more specialized e g  design thinking  front end development  etc \n",
      "\n",
      "Can you tell us a little bit about the ideal student for Ironhack’s UX UI Design Bootcamp  What’s your class like right now  And how do the UX students differ from the coding bootcamp students \n",
      "\n",
      "The ideal student for the UX UI Design Bootcamp is someone who possesses strong communication skills  can use empathy to jump into other people’s shoes  and has a passion for user experience  The current class is a wonderful mix of many professional backgrounds  for example  some profiles include a former Marketing Manager for Sony Music  a Research Director from the non profit space  and an MBA grad looking to use their previous Business Process skills to crack into the UX sector \n",

      "Ironhack is an immersive iOS and Web Development bootcamp that started in Spain and has now expanded to Miami  With a hiring network and happy alumni  Ironhack is a great Florida bootcamp option  But what exactly does it take to get into Ironhack  We caught up with the Ironhack team to learn everything you need to know about the Ironhack application and interview process  including how long it will take  their current acceptance rate  and a sneak peek at the questions you ll hear in the interview  \n",
      "\n",
      "The Application\n",
      "\n",
      "How long does the Ironhack application typically take \n",
      "\n",
      "The Ironhack application process falls into 3 stages  the written application  first interview  and second technical interview  and takes on average  10 15 days to complete in entirety \n",
      "\n",
      "What goes into the written application  Does Ironhack require a video submission \n",
      "\n",
      "The written application is a chance for students to give a quick summary of their background and motivations for wanting to attend  It’s their opportunity to tell us about themselves in a nutshell and peak the admission committee’s interest \n",
      "\n",
      "What types of backgrounds have successful Ironhack students had  Does everyone come from a technical background \n",
      "\n",
      "We are impressed and inspired by the diversity of students that Ironhack attracts  We’ve had former flight attendants  world travelling yoginis  and CS grads from Ivy Leagues all attend Ironhack  We’ve been amazed at how coding is so democratic and attracts all sorts of people  regardless of educational background or pedigree  Those who tend to perform the best at Ironhack are those who have committed to doing so  not necessarily those with a technical background \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The Interview\n",
      "\n",
      "Can you give us a sample question from the “first interview ”\n",
      "\n",
      "“What motivates you on a day to day basis and what do you love to do ”\n",
      "\n",
      "Can you give us a sample question from the “technical interview ”\n",
      "\n",
      "“What happens when you put a function inside a loop ”\n",
      "\n",
      "What are a few resources that you suggest applicants use to really ace the technical interview \n",
      "\n",
      "When an applicant is in the midst of our process  we actually send them materials specifically to prepare for the technical interview and set office hours with our Teaching Assistants  so they can get some one on one time to address specific questions  Apart from that  If they already have some experience programming  https   autotelicum github io Smooth CoffeeScript literate js intro html  We recommend this resource for complete beginners  JavaScript for Cats  http   jsforcats com \n",
      "\n",
      "How do you evaluate an applicant’s future potential  What qualities are you looking for \n",
      "\n",
      "Ironhack’s application process reveals a lot of qualities in potential candidates because it is a bit longer than most coding schools  The advantage of this is  it allows us to see how candidates and applicants respond to learning material in a short amount of time  and how dedicated they are to their goals  If they can’t even complete the interview process  it’s an indicator that they might not have the passion or drive to get through 8 weeks of a coding bootcamp  We look for curiosity  passion  and drive  Drive is probably the most important quality to succeed at Ironhack \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Is there a technical coding challenge in the Ironhack Application \n",
      "\n",
      "Yes \n",
      "\n",
      "How long should it take  Is there a time limit \n",
      "\n",
      "We give our students exactly 7 days to prepare for the technical interview after the 1st interview and provide the materials they need to prep for it  The technical interview is led by one of our Miami instructors and consists of a coding challenge that the applicant has 30 minutes to solve \n",
      "\n",
      "Can an applicant complete the coding challenge in any programming language \n",
      "\n",
      "The applicant can complete the challenge in whatever programming language they feel most comfortable in as long as that language can solve a breadth of problems  That means that something like CSS is out \n",
      "\n",
      "Getting Accepted\n",
      "\n",
      "What is the current acceptance rate at Ironhack \n",
      "\n",
      "As of now  our current acceptance rate is ~20   23 5   to be exact  \n",
      "\n",
      "Are students accepted on a rolling basis \n",
      "\n",
      "Yes  Spots fill up quickly  so the sooner the applicant gets started  the better \n",
      "\n",
      "Does Ironhack Miami have a lot of international students since your roots are in Spain  Do international students get student visas tourist visas to do the program \n",
      "\n",
      "Yes  We have more than 25 countries represented in our bootcamps globally  e g  Thailand  Pakistan  Germany  France  Brazil  etc   The majority of our students who travel to Miami from abroad use a tourist visa to visit the US and attend our program  We love the melting pot of Miami combined with Ironhack’s reputation globally  It’s really a fun place to learn and study \n",

      "It would be impossible to learn what I ve learned in IronHack in two months on my own  But it s not only about the development skills that I ve improved in those two months  it´s also about the personal skills that I´ve been able to develop and the opportunity to meet the best IT professionals from all around Spain  IronHack was just a 180º experience that changed my whole life  and that allowed me to do what I believe I was born to do \n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "IronHack is an 8 week coding bootcamp with campuses in Madrid  Barcelona  and soon  Miami  We talked with cofounder Ariel Quinones about their Rails curriculum  how they attract American students to  study abroad  in Spain  and what sets Ironhack apart  \n",
      "\n",
      " \n",
      "\n",
      "Tell us about how IronHack started \n",
      "\n",
      "I come from a finance background  I’m originally from Puerto Rico  but spent 5 years in New York  My cofounder Gonzalo comes from the construction industry  he’s a civil engineer and he built all sorts of major infrastructure projects in Europe  Having said that  I come from a household of educators  Both of my parents were teachers when I was growing up and my father actually started a private university in Puerto Rico 20 years ago that started with 15 students and now they have 6 campuses and over 10 000 students enrolled \n",
      "\n",
      "I think education was always a part of my DNA and I wanted to do something after completing my education  I met Gonzalo during our MBA  we were both at Wharton  He also wanted to do something in education in Europe and possibly in ed tech as well  During those 2 years of the MBA we were iterating ideas  constantly and I think had the same issue that most non technical founders have in the U S   which is having brilliant “ideas” but once you get to the point where you need to execute them and produce an MVP  you’re not able to do it  It’s incredibly challenging to find a cofounder and it’s incredibly challenging from a cost and also from an operational perspective to outsource the development \n",
      "\n",
      "Gonzalo and I took a 2 day course at Wharton where they taught us to do very basic Rails  Even though we didn’t acquire the skills necessary to build our MVP  we were excited about the possibility of teaching both technical and non technical people these skills through a highly intensive and compressed time period  After that experience  we started looking at the boot camp model  At that point  the earlier ones were starting to get a little bit of traction  We thought it would be interesting to do this somewhere abroad  I’d done a lot of business in Latin America so I had some ties to the region  Gonzalo  my partner is Spanish  so our first bet was Spain \n",
      "\n",
      " \n",
      "\n",
      "Would you say that IronHack is more geared towards makers or technical cofounders as opposed to people who want to get a job at an established company as a junior developer \n",
      "\n",
      "We’ve had both profiles  We’ve been selective in the people we admit from a technical background  We’ve been hesitant so far to say “go from total newbie to professional web developer in X weeks ” Our approach is appealing to folks that are maybe already in close touch with technology and code  Developers that want to professionalize their skills and take them to the next level  or people that are very smart  analytical and are looking for a hardcore experience that will allow them to learn from these types of people \n",
      "\n",
      " \n",
      "\n",
      "When was the first cohort \n",
      "\n",
      "The first cohort was in October of 2013  Each course is 8 weeks long \n",
      "\n",
      " \n",
      "\n",
      "What was the biggest lesson that you learned after running your first cohort \n",
      "\n",
      "One thing we learned is that the 8 weeks just fly by  When you plan for people to be coding 10 to 12 hours a day  that seems like a lot but every day goes by so quickly \n",
      "\n",
      "The other thing we learned was that no matter how much you filter to make sure you don’t have disparate levels prior to arriving  people just learn differently  at different velocities with different learning styles  So within the structure of 8 weeks we needed different exercises and flexibility to give people the chance to learn right at their own pace  while ensuring that everyone’s learning fundamentals \n",
      "\n",
      " \n",
      "\n",
      "Do you have students do pre work before they get to IronHack \n",
      "\n",
      "Yeah  they do 100 hours of pre work \n",

      " \n",

      "What cities are you live in now \n",
      "\n",
      "We’re live in Madrid and Barcelona and we’re launching in Miami in September \n",
      "\n",
      " \n",
      "\n",
      "Could you tell us about the tech scenes in the locations that you’re live in  Madrid and Barcelona \n",
      "\n",
      "People love to come to Spain and study abroad  It’s a country that has a lot to offer from the lifestyle perspective  you know  you have great food  the parties… study abroad in Spain has been an integral part of Spanish society for many years  within the traditional higher education arena  In our case  we’re trying to position Spain in a similar fashion  In the first cohorts we trained a lot of people from Spain  but going forward we want to make it attractive for foreigners to come over and enjoy everything that Spain has to offer and at the same time  learn how to code \n",
      "\n",
      "Barcelona is very exciting because you have people from all over the world that are launching startups there  Obviously within the EU there’s a lot of mobility  if you’re a European Union citizen  you can go anywhere without any sort of visa requirements  And I think a lot of northern Europeans and people from Germany for instance  love Barcelona for weather reasons  the great beaches  the lifestyle… so a lot of them are coming over to Barcelona to launch their own ventures here  In Barcelona  the tech ecosystem is thriving and it’s very international  There’s a lot of mobile startups that are getting traction over there \n",
      "\n",
      "Madrid is still very much a cosmopolitan city and we’re seeing a lot of traction in the startup space  It’s obviously an emerging ecosystem  nowhere near Silicon Valley  but we’re seeing early stage companies  get either acquired or go for substantial rounds of financing here in Madrid  which is ultimately a driver for our type of business  Companies need funding to employ engineers and we’re seeing that capital flow to early stage projects \n",
      "\n",
      " \n",
      "\n",
      "Do you get interest from people in the U S  \n",
      "\n",
      "Yes  right now we’re getting a lot of interest from people all over the world  including the U S  I interviewed a few candidates from the Northeast  we have another student from California who’s enrolling in our June course \n",
      "\n",
      " \n",
      "\n",
      "Is it possible for someone from the U S  to complete IronHack and then work in Spain or in the EU \n",
      "\n",
      "Yes  it’s definitely possible  It’s not as challenging as someone from Europe to go to the U S  For sure  there’s still costs that the employer has to incur but it has nowhere near the costs and all the red tape that you have to deal with in the U S \n",
      "\n",
      " \n",
      "\n",
      "Has IronHack raised any money \n",
      "\n",
      "No  right now we’re bootstrapped and we want to keep it that way as long as possible \n",
      "\n",
      " \n",
      "\n",
      "So tell us what programming languages students are mastering at IronHack  tell us about the teaching style \n",
      "\n",
      "We have two courses that are live right now  Web and Mobile \n",
      "\n",
      "The Web course is an 8 week course  I’d say on average  students are with us in our offices 10   12 hours a day  We cover HTML  CSS and JavaScript on the front end  and then on the back we work with Ruby on Rails and teach a little bit of Sinatra as well  The first 6 weeks we’re teaching those core technologies  And the last 2 weeks  students are working on their own project from scratch  The culmination of the program is a demo day where they present their projects to the community  developers  startup cofounders  that type of audience \n",
      "\n",
      "I’d say 90  of our content is practical  We’re big believers in the flipped classroom model  so we want to make sure that we reduce the amount of theory time to the extent possible  We get them all the resources  videos and exercises to complete at home prior to arriving here  While they’re here we give them homework and assignments for the weekend so we can reduce that theory time \n",
      "\n",
      "The technology demands in Spain are very fragmented  It’s not like San Francisco where you can produce a gazillion Ruby on Rails grads every year and they’ll be hired by Rails startups  Here  we’re seeing some demand for Rails startups   but also Python  PHP  etc \n",
      "\n",
      " \n",
      "\n",
      "Do you expect that after completing your course  a graduate would be able to learn Python or PHP on their own \n",
      "\n",
      "A hundred percent  and we’re seeing that  Even though love the technologies we work with  we’re not obsessed with them either  To us they’re an instrument to teach good development practices  I think one thing that differentiates us from boot camps is our focus and obsession with good coding practices  We’re obsessed with testing  clean code and good design patterns  We’ve done our job if the student get a good background in technology but more importantly  take away those good coding practices that they apply to whatever language or framework they use \n",
      "\n",
      " \n",
      "\n",
      "Is the mobile class structured the same way \n",
      "\n",
      "Same format  exact same structure  slightly higher requirements to be accepted  In order to be accepted into the mobile course  you already have to program with another object oriented language  Our first course is focused on IOS development \n",
      "\n",
      " \n",
      "\n",
      "Do you think you’ll ever do an Android course \n",
      "\n",
      "We’ll probably do Android in the near future \n",
      "\n",
      " \n",
      "\n",
      "How many students do you have in each cohort \n",
      "\n",
      "Right now we’ve capped at 20  We can probably go a bit more than that but we don’t want to do more than that \n",
      "\n",
      " \n",
      "\n",
      "How many instructors do you have per class \n",
      "\n",
      "We always like to have a ratio of at least 6 students per teacher  So when we have 15 students  we have one main professor and two teaching assistants  Our view is that if we’re going to teach you one technology  we want to make sure that the person that is instructing you is the best  most capable person and is highly specialized in that language \n",
      "\n",
      " \n",
      "\n",
      "How have you found instructors \n",
      "\n",
      "We went to the best companies here in Spain and other parts of Europe and basically found the best people there  They work part time for us  It’s very different to have someone who’s fulltime boot camp professor versus someone who is a developer and is teaching at a boot camp for 2 weeks \n",
      "\n",
      "And also from a recruiting perspective  a lot of our students have been hired by their teachers  Also  our students have a network that goes beyond their peers and the Ironhack staff  they have a network that connects to all these companies that these professors are coming from \n",
      "\n",
      " \n",
      "\n",
      "You said that potential students should have some vested interest in programming and should have some background and be able to prove that they can really handle the material  What’s the application process \n",
      "\n",
      "We have a 3 step application process  The first part is a written form that we screen and then we do two 30 minute Skype interviews  The first 30 minute Skype interview is to get a sense of who you are  why you want to do this  and get a sense of is you fit within our culture  and if you have that intrinsic motivation to make the most out of the 400 hours that you have here \n",
      "\n",
      "We say “Listen  you’re going to be coding Monday through Friday  10 hours a day and then you’re going to have work every day on Saturday Sunday…” When I tell them that  we want someone who beams energy and positivity  If they make it through that interview  we have a second round  which is basically to assess technical skills  We’ve actually accepted a bunch of people that have never programmed before  but we want to make sure that you have the motivation and the analytical skill set to be able to catch up prior to arriving to our camp \n",
      "\n",
      "In some cases  we have people that we think are very smart and incredibly motivated but have never coded in their lives  have never even worked with HTML  We admit them subject to another valuation post that second interview  So we’ll get them to complete 60 hours of pre work and then see where they are \n",
      "\n",
      " \n",
      "\n",
      "How does IronHack prepare your graduates to find jobs \n",
      "\n",
      "The demo day is a great way to showcase our talent to our employers  and you have all sorts of employers there from the founding stage where they haven’t raised any money or are still pre product  to tech employers who have technical teams and more than 30  40 employees\n",
      "\n",
      "On top of the core curriculum we have speakers like employers come in during the 8 weeks to present their products and also it serves as an opportunity for them to get in touch with their students and identify potential hiring leads \n",
      "\n",
      "We also bring in leading HR people from some of our top tech employers here to offer workshops on how to set up your CV  how to optimize your LinkedIn profile  SEO and all these things  And we coach them on how to conduct an interview  Right now we’ve had the luxury of being small so we’re all very involved in the process \n",
      "\n",
      " \n",
      "\n",
      "Are those companies paying a fee to get into the demo day or are they paying a recruiting fee once they’ve hired someone \n",
      "\n",
      "Right now we’re not charging employers  We’re focused on placing 100  of our graduates and giving access to great companies  even those that wouldn’t be interested in paying a recruiting fee   \n",
      "\n",
      " \n",
      "\n",
      "Have you been successful in placing your graduates \n",
      "\n",
      "We’re starting to place a second cohort but in our first cohort  we placed nearly 100  percent of our graduates  I think in the first cohort we placed 60  of the people 3 week after the first course  and then the rest over the next 2 months \n",
      "\n",
      " \n",
      "\n",
      "Is the accreditation buzz that’s happening in California anywhere on your radar  Do you get any pressure from the government in Spain or are you thinking about going through the accreditation process when you expand to Miami \n",
      "\n",
      "We’re definitely going to pay attention to this in Miami  We’re all for it if it helps the student  as long as it doesn’t interfere with the model and doesn’t limit the ability of these institutions to offer education that’s agile and that can adapt to the times and the technologies \n",
      "\n",
      " \n",
      "\n",
      "Are you planning on expanding beyond Miami anytime soon \n",
      "\n",
      "I think for the next year or even beyond that  we’re going to focus on Miami and Spain  However  we’re going to use Miami and Spain as hubs for other regions  We’re getting a lot of interest from Latin American Students to come to Spain  so for those who would rather come to Miami because it’s closer  we can offer that as well \n",

      "\n",
      "Data cleaning edit \n",
      "Once processed and organised  the data may be incomplete  contain duplicates  or contain errors  The need for data cleaning will arise from problems in the way that data is entered and stored  Data cleaning is the process of preventing and correcting these errors  Common tasks include record matching  identifying inaccuracy of data  overall quality of existing data 5 deduplication  and column segmentation 6 Such data problems can also be identified through a variety of analytical techniques  For example  with financial information  the totals for particular variables may be compared against separately published numbers believed to be reliable 7 Unusual amounts above or below pre determined thresholds may also be reviewed   There are several types of data cleaning that depend on the type of data such as phone numbers  email addresses  employers etc   Quantitative data methods for outlier detection can be used to get rid of likely incorrectly entered data  Textual data spell checkers can be used to lessen the amount of mistyped words  but it is harder to tell if the words themselves are correct 8\n",

      "Effective analysis requires obtaining relevant facts to answer questions  support a conclusion or formal opinion  or test hypotheses  Facts by definition are irrefutable  meaning that any person involved in the analysis should be able to agree upon them  For example  in August 2010  the Congressional Budget Office  CBO  estimated that extending the Bush tax cuts of 2001 and 2003 for the 2011 2020 time period would add approximately  3 3 trillion to the national debt 18 Everyone should be able to agree that indeed this is what CBO reported  they can all examine the report  This makes it a fact  Whether persons agree or disagree with the CBO is their own opinion \n",

      "Analysts may also analyze data under different assumptions or scenarios  For example  when analysts perform financial statement analysis  they will often recast the financial statements under different assumptions to help arrive at an estimate of future cash flow  which they then discount to present value based on some interest rate  to determine the valuation of the company or its stock   Similarly  the CBO analyzes the effects of various policy options on the government s revenue  outlays and deficits  creating alternative future scenarios for key measures \n",

      "In the main analysis phase either an exploratory or confirmatory approach can be adopted  Usually the approach is decided before data is collected  In an exploratory analysis no clear hypothesis is stated before analysing the data  and the data is searched for models that describe the data well  In a confirmatory analysis clear hypotheses about the data are tested \n",
      "Exploratory data analysis should be interpreted carefully  When testing multiple models at once there is a high chance on finding at least one of them to be significant  but this can be due to a type 1 error  It is important to always adjust the significance level when testing multiple models with  for example  a Bonferroni correction  Also  one should not follow up an exploratory analysis with a confirmatory analysis in the same dataset  An exploratory analysis is used to find ideas for a theory  but not to test that theory as well  When a model is found exploratory in a dataset  then following up that analysis with a confirmatory analysis in the same dataset could simply mean that the results of the confirmatory analysis are due to the same type 1 error that resulted in the exploratory model in the first place  The confirmatory analysis therefore will not be more informative than the original exploratory analysis 37\n",

      "What is Lorem Ipsum \n",
      "Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry  Lorem Ipsum has been the industry s standard dummy text ever since the 1500s  when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book  It has survived not only five centuries  but also the leap into electronic typesetting  remaining essentially unchanged  It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages  and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum \n",
      "\n",
      "Why do we use it \n",
      "It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page when looking at its layout  The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more or less normal distribution of letters  as opposed to using  Content here  content here   making it look like readable English  Many desktop publishing packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text  and a search for  lorem ipsum  will uncover many web sites still in their infancy  Various versions have evolved over the years  sometimes by accident  sometimes on purpose  injected humour and the like  \n",
      "\n",
      "Where does it come from \n",
      "Contrary to popular belief  Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text  It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC  making it over 2000 years old  Richard McClintock  a Latin professor at Hampden Sydney College in Virginia  looked up one of the more obscure Latin words  consectetur  from a Lorem Ipsum passage  and going through the cites of the word in classical literature  discovered the undoubtable source  Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1 10 32 and 1 10 33 of  de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum   The Extremes of Good and Evil  by Cicero  written in 45 BC  This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics  very popular during the Renaissance  The first line of Lorem Ipsum   Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet     comes from a line in section 1 10 32 The standard chunk of Lorem Ipsum used since the 1500s is reproduced below for those interested  Sections 1 10 32 and 1 10 33 from  de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum  by Cicero are also reproduced in their exact original form  accompanied by English versions from the 1914 translation by H  Rackham \n",
      "\n",
      "Where can I get some \n",
      "There are many variations of passages of Lorem Ipsum available  but the majority have suffered alteration in some form  by injected humour  or randomised words which don t look even slightly believable  If you are going to use a passage of Lorem Ipsum  you need to be sure there isn t anything embarrassing hidden in the middle of text  All the Lorem Ipsum generators on the Internet tend to repeat predefined chunks as necessary  making this the first true generator on the Internet  It uses a dictionary of over 200 Latin words  combined with a handful of model sentence structures  to generate Lorem Ipsum which looks reasonable  The generated Lorem Ipsum is therefore always free from repetition  injected humour  or non characteristic words etc \n",

      " But I must explain to you how all this mistaken idea of denouncing pleasure and praising pain was born and I will give you a complete account of the system  and expound the actual teachings of the great explorer of the truth  the master builder of human happiness  No one rejects  dislikes  or avoids pleasure itself  because it is pleasure  but because those who do not know how to pursue pleasure rationally encounter consequences that are extremely painful  Nor again is there anyone who loves or pursues or desires to obtain pain of itself  because it is pain  but because occasionally circumstances occur in which toil and pain can procure him some great pleasure  To take a trivial example  which of us ever undertakes laborious physical exercise  except to obtain some advantage from it  But who has any right to find fault with a man who chooses to enjoy a pleasure that has no annoying consequences  or one who avoids a pain that produces no resultant pleasure  \n",
      "Section 1 10 33 of  de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum   written by Cicero in 45 BC\n",
      " At vero eos et accusamus et iusto odio dignissimos ducimus qui blanditiis praesentium voluptatum deleniti atque corrupti quos dolores et quas molestias excepturi sint occaecati cupiditate non provident  similique sunt in culpa qui officia deserunt mollitia animi  id est laborum et dolorum fuga  Et harum quidem rerum facilis est et expedita distinctio  Nam libero tempore  cum soluta nobis est eligendi optio cumque nihil impedit quo minus id quod maxime placeat facere possimus  omnis voluptas assumenda est  omnis dolor repellendus  Temporibus autem quibusdam et aut officiis debitis aut rerum necessitatibus saepe eveniet ut et voluptates repudiandae sint et molestiae non recusandae  Itaque earum rerum hic tenetur a sapiente delectus  ut aut reiciendis voluptatibus maiores alias consequatur aut perferendis doloribus asperiores repellat  \n",
      "1914 translation by H  Rackham\n",
      " On the other hand  we denounce with righteous indignation and dislike men who are so beguiled and demoralized by the charms of pleasure of the moment  so blinded by desire  that they cannot foresee the pain and trouble that are bound to ensue  and equal blame belongs to those who fail in their duty through weakness of will  which is the same as saying through shrinking from toil and pain  These cases are perfectly simple and easy to distinguish  In a free hour  when our power of choice is untrammelled and when nothing prevents our being able to do what we like best  every pleasure is to be welcomed and every pain avoided  But in certain circumstances and owing to the claims of duty or the obligations of business it will frequently occur that pleasures have to be repudiated and annoyances accepted  The wise man therefore always holds in these matters to this principle of selection  he rejects pleasures to secure other greater pleasures  or else he endures pains to avoid worse pains  \n",
